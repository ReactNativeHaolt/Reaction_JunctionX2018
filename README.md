Inspiration 

We love conversations. When it comes to group activities, conversation is even more important cuz it connects people, brings fun, and surprisingly, solves problems.
What it does Hence, we create a chatroom for a group of friends to gather and discuss everything relating to an activity: planning, preparation, gossiping, and most important - recording expenses and calculating individual cost. The app auto return one and only action a person need to take to cancel out all debt and loan, based on a fixed rule that helps minimize the number of transaction within a group.

How we built it

Challenges we ran into building the mathematical logic, designing a comprehensive but fun chatting interface.
Accomplishments that we're proud of Unique idea about expenses log via chat message and make "reactions" to count individual into an expense. Great UI. Logical code.
What we learned Brainstorming under high pressure of time; think out of the box, working with firebase and react.
